# Project OceanGate

A **CS-341 Final Project** simulating an underwater environment inspired by *Subnautica*, centered around the submerged wreck of the OceanGate submarine. The scene captures the eerie beauty of the ocean depths, populated with fish using boid-based movement and enhanced by a range of real-time graphics effects.

## Features

* **Fog**: Post-processing based atmospheric attenuation for underwater depth perception.
* **Bloom**: HDR-based glow effects using Gaussian blur and luminance thresholding.
* **Boids**: Schooling fish with smooth, flocking behavior and jitter randomness.
* **FPS Camera**: Free-roaming first-person camera with mouse-look and keyboard navigation.
* **Bezier Camera**: Cinematic fly-through animation using BÃ©zier curves.
* **2D Terrain Generation**: Procedural seabed using Perlin and dendry-inspired noise.
* **Normal Mapping**: Realistic surface detail using procedural textures.
* **Modeling**: Custom Blender-made submarine, fish, and rocks.
* **Alpha Cutouts**: Coral-like decorations with alpha texture discard for performance.
