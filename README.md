# Project OceanGate

A **CS-341 Final Project** simulating an underwater environment inspired by *Subnautica*, centered around the submerged wreck of the OceanGate submarine. The scene captures the eerie beauty of the ocean depths, populated with fish using boid-based movement and enhanced by a range of real-time graphics effects.

## Features

* 🌫️ **Fog**: Post-processing based atmospheric attenuation for underwater depth perception.
* 💡 **Bloom**: HDR-based glow effects using Gaussian blur and luminance thresholding.
* 🐟 **Boids**: Schooling fish with smooth, flocking behavior and jitter randomness.
* 🧭 **FPS Camera**: Free-roaming first-person camera with mouse-look and keyboard navigation.
* 🧭 **Bezier Camera**: Cinematic fly-through animation using Bézier curves.
* 🗺️ **2D Terrain Generation**: Procedural seabed using Perlin and dendry-inspired noise.
* 🪨 **Normal Mapping**: Realistic surface detail using procedural textures.
* 🛠️ **Modeling**: Custom Blender-made submarine, fish, and rocks.
* 🪸 **Alpha Cutouts**: Coral-like decorations with alpha texture discard for performance.



## Setup

1. Clone the repo
